# About Me!
Hello,thank you for visiting my GitHub page. I'm a high school student really into programming and STEM who goes by Explorer Official. What you will see on my page is the content I'm working on along with some source code that's free to access.

**Summary:**
 I go by Explorer, a high school student who programs in their free time. My main interests are astronomy and computer science. 
I work with several programming languages at least a little bit that were needed for my learning such as HTML & CSS, JavaScript, DART, TypeScript, C#, Java. 
Most of my education is self taught, but I'm actively using the opportunity to join various computer science classes offered at my school like Web Development, Computer Science I & II, AP Computer Science A, and Advanced Computer Projects.
My learning is mostly project based, so I have a lot of projects I'm working on such as my personal website, a spaceflight informational mobile app, and a clicker game made with Unity. I don't have a direct email address you can contact me with, but you can get ahold of me through various platforms I'm active on.

## Top Interests

### Astronomy
This is my largest interest, it's been my entire life since 2nd grade in elementary school. This subject is used to drive what I'm creating programming wise.

### Computer Science
Computer Science is one of my favorite intersts also, my projects are mainly hobby/enjoyment based rather than going professionally or solving an issue. I use them to express my passions and just because I enjoy it.

## Programming Languages
I don't try to learn everything within a programming language, I only learn what I need to know. Although I know the basic concepts that are pretty much universal to every programming language (variables, loops, conditionals, etc).

### Front End Web Development
Although not technically programming languages, I did start my programming journey with HTML and CSS when learning how to make a website. I did most of my learning on W3Schools and those skills got straigthened within my school's Web Development class. I know very basic JavaScript which I have been able to use in order to make responsive navigation bars. I can build basic to intermediate level static websites designed to display information.

### DART
The first actual programming language I started to learn is DART when I got into the Flutter framework. This language is what introduced me to things like functions and declaring variables. It's where I learned to write my first "Hello, World!" print statement. I haven't ever used it alone, just within Flutter.

### TypeScript
I'm currently learning TypeScript with the React Native framework as I find it less of a learning curve than Flutter. It's not very hard to learn as the syntax is very similar to HTML and CSS with minor differences.

### C#
I'm also learning C# as I've recently got interestied in learning games with Unity. I didn't feel the need to learn the programming languge alone as I already know the programming fundamental concepts (loops, variables, conditionals, etc.), so just started creating with Unity once I got familiar with the UI.

### Java
Java is one of the most, if not the most popular programming language out there. Currently taking Computer Science I and II within this school year which is teaching us the Java programming language.

## Education
Basically everything I've learned is self taught with the exception of Java, but here are some information on the classes I've taken and plan to take.

### High School

#### Web Development
This is a class meant to introduce people to HTML and CSS. By the end of the year long class, you'll have the capabilities to create a static multi page website with the main focus on developing a portfolio hosted on Github Pages. By the time I joined the class, I already knew the basics of HTML and CSS, the most helpful material were the projects themselves since they forced me to apply my HTML and CSS knowledge. This is where I also got introduced to Bootstrap although I prefer not to use it.

#### Computer Science
This current Semester, I'm taking Computer Science I and will take Computer Science II next semester. The focus is to teach you the basic concepts of programming with the Java language. Although I've never touched Java before this class, I came into the class pretty prepared since I already know the fundemntals of programming. The main thing I have to learn is syntax.

#### AP Computer Science A
Not taking this class, but plan on taking AP Computer Science A next year once I've completed the two required computer science classes. This is a college level class designed to go deeper into the Java programming language which may give college credit at the end of the AP exam.

#### Advanced Computer Projects
Advanced Computer Projects is not a typical class, it's a self paced class where you choose any project to work on computer science related. This could be learning a new programming language, game engine, web development, etc. It's a repeatable credit semester class, so I plan on taking it every semester until graduation. I've been using the class to build a game throughout the semester to learn game development on Unity. Autodidacticism is a needed skill since the entire class is self paced. The teacher is there to help you if needed, but most of the time I need to rely on resolving the issue myself since they are running a computer science class simutaniously.

## Projects
There are quite a bit I have started mostly because there is a lot I want to learn. My learning is mainly project based because that's what works best for me. Relavant projects are web, app, and game development. I started larning web development September 2024, app development December 2024, and then game development September 2025.

### Web Development
I don't do a lot here, I haven't made a lot of websites. I mostly focus on adding onto my own personal website, [stellarfacts.com](https://www.stellarfacts.com) rather than creating lots of them. Mostly contains HTML and CSS, and a small percentage of JavaScript for responsive navbars.

### App Development
I have a published app named Explorer, it's the only app I've worked on and published. I may publish more in the future, but right now it's only available on Google Play with Apple planned soon. It's made with Flutter, but I'm in the process of porting it into React Native since I've decided to switch frameworks. Explorer is static and is focused on providing information on spaceflight.

#### Game Development
Right now, I'm developing a simple, horribly made clicker game to learn how to develop games. It's set for release on February 1, 2026 and will be my first game published. My goal project is a 2-D colony builder game called Space Colony. You can learn more on [Itch.io](https://explorer-official.itch.io/).

I don't provide an email address for you to directly contact me, but there are some platforms you can reach me on.
